SwiftTweetGettr
===============

New to iOS or Swift? This tiny twitter client project will hopefully get you started building your own apps or seeing common iOS patterns in Swift.

You'll need to replace the API Key and API Secret in the Client class with those of your own. You can get them by getting a Twitter developer account and creating an app. Just go here: https://apps.twitter.com/app/new
